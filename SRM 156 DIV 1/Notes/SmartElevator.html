    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
    The current state can be described fully with the following variables:
    <ul>
        <li>A set of passengers waiting to be picked up.</li>
        <li>A set of passengers currently in the elevator.</li>
        <li>The floor the elevator is currently on.</li>
        <li>How much time has elapsed.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  At any point, the elevator can either move to pick someone up, or move to drop
  them off.  This solution uses recursion to try every possible combination.
</p>
<p>
  The timeWaiting() method just initializes the simulations with an empty elevator,
  everyone in the waiting Set, and the elevator on floor 1 at time 0.
</p>
<p>
  In moveElevator() we first check to see if we're done - that is, the elevator is
  empty and nobody is waiting to be picked up.  If that's the case, then we'll
  update minFinishTime to the smaller of it's current value and our current time.
</p>
<p>
  If we're not done, then we'll recursively call moveElevator with every possible
  combination of picking up or dropping off a passenger.
</p>
<p>
  To simulate picking up a passenger, we create a newWaiting set that contains all
  the members of the current waiting set, except for the person that we're picking up.
  We then create a newElevator set using the contents of the current elevator set and add
  the new passenger.  The travel time is calculated between floors, and our newTime
  becomes the greater of the time when the elevator arrives, and the arrival time
  for that person.  moveElevator() is then recursively callled with the new parameters.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, to drop someone off, we create a newElevator set that contains everyone from
  the current elevator set except the person that we dropped off.  There is no need
  to create a newWaiting set, since that will not have changed.  Again, the times
  are calculated moveElevator() gets called recursively.
</p>
<p>
  When all of the scenarios have completed, minFinishTime will contain the shortest
  time in which all passengers can be serviced, so we just return that.
