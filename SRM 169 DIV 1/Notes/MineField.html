    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
	  This is a pretty easy Divison 1 problem, with just a few tricks to overcome.  First, I'll
	  begin by saying I was tripped up by the ordering of the coordinates.  I assumed that the
	  numbers were in the form (x, y).  They're not.  The description says they're given as (row, col).
	  In other words (y, x).  After seeing my output sideways, I tracked the error down and fixed it.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The first problem to solve is parsing the input.  For this, first I replaced all parenthesis and
	  commas with spaces.  Then I created a scanner that uses whitespace as the delimeter.  With that,
	  I can just use a pair of nextInt() calls to get the coordinates until they run out.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  I find these problems much easier to work with using char arrays.  I'll often convert the
	  given String[] into a char[][] just to simplify.  In this case, I represent the mineField
	  as a char[][] and then convert it to a String[] when returning the result.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	   With the coordinates, and the mineField, the next problem is to add the mine to the
	   current board.  That's just a matter of setting that location to 'M', and then updating
	   all the neighbors.  I use a nested for loop to visit all the neighbors of the given location
	   working top to bottom and left to right.  For each location, check to ensure that we're
	   not outside the boundaries of the array, and that the square is not already marked as
	   a mine.  If that test passes, then increment the value stored there.  Since we can
	   treat chars as ints here, mineField[r][c]++ will work nicely.
	 </p>
