    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  The quilt is represented as a 2 dimensional array of ints, where the value of each location is an index into the colorList array.  We start by initializing
  each location in the quilt to -1 to indicate that the color has not yet been choosen.
</p>

<p>
  The next step is to determine where the first patch will be located.  Here it might help to draw some examples out on paper.  You'll find that the origin
  works out to x = width / 2  and y = length / 2.  Remember, the / operator removes any decimal portion of the division, effectively rounding down.
</p>

<p>
  To determine the color of the first patch, we simply implement the 3 rules that were given.  This is found in getPatchColor().  getLeastNeighbor() looks
  at the 9 positions surrounding the current location, and counts the number of times each color appears.  Here we have to be careful not to look outside
  the bounds of the arrays, and to ignore any place where the color has not been set.  Once we've counted how many times each color appears, we find the
  smallest number, and finally return a list that contains all colors whose count is equal to that smallest number.
</p>

<p>
  If the list size is 1, we're done.  If there are ties, we move on to rule 2.   The array colorUsageQuilt keeps track of how many times each color
  is used in the entire quilt.  We use this and similar logic as before to return the colors that came out of rule 1 which now match the minimum count.  If there
  are still ties, we just return the color with the smallest index.
</p>

<p>
  That takes care of determining the color for a patch.  The next step is to devise a method to move from one patch to the next following the outward spiraling pattern.
  Here the arrays spiralX and spiralY come into play and the related variables diretion, lineLength, and lineLengthMax.  direction provides an index into spiralX
  and spiralY to get the change in x and y to move to the next location.  We also keep track of the current line length, and the maximum length for the current line.
  This tells us when to change direction.
</p>

<p>
  Initially the direction is to the right, and the lineLengthMax is 1.  Then we set the color of the first patch, and lineLength becomes 1.  This matches
  lineLengthMax, so we increment direction (mod 4) which corresponds to up, and reset lineLength.  Whenever the direction changes to up or down, we increment
  lineLengthMax.  This setup gives us a nice counter-clockwise outward spiral movement.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, we just need to loop through the number of patches, setting the color at each, and then moving on to the next patch.  After all the patches have
  been set, we need to back up one place since we'll have moved on to the next location.  Then just return the color there.  Remember, the value at that location
  is an index into colorList.
