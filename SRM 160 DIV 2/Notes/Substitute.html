    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

    <p>
        The solution begins by initializing an int (result) to zero.  Each time we encounter a character that is in key, we'll multiply
        result by 10, and then add the new number.  This is a pretty standard way of parsing characters into integers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The for loop on line 7 iterates through each character in the code.  Line 9 sets p to the index in key of the current character.  If
        that character does not appear in the key, indexOf() will return -1, and we'll move on to the next character.
    </p>

    <p>
        If indexOf() returns a non-negative index (the current character in code appears in the key), then we use that as the next digit.  Note
        howerver, that the values are off by one, so we need to add one to the value returned by indexOf() and also do a mod 10.  This maps
        index 0 to 1, index 1 to 2, ... and index 9 to 0 (10 mod 10).
