    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

<p>
  Possibly the most confusing problem statement I've come across so far on TopCoder.  The
  solution above passes all of the system tests, but I still have no idea what the problem
  is asking for.
</p>

<p>
  My advice is to ignore almost everything in the problem statement and notes.  The mention of possible geometric
  sequences, trailing zeros in the binary representation of the number, answers being positive or negative, etc.
  are all irrelevant.  There is no need to examine the binary representation of any numbers, or calculate geometric
  sequences.  Here, in one sentence, is what you need to do:
</p>

<p>
  For each possible sub-sequence in d[], determine if the values are evenly spaced.  That's it!
</p>

<p>
  Any sub-sequence of size 1 or 2 will be evenly spaced by definition, and therefore included in the count.
  For larger sub-sequences, calculate the step size by subtraction: d[x+1] - d[x].  Now, test to see if each
  d[i] + step = d[i + 1]  for all values of i between x and j.
</p>

<p>
  The following tables illustrates the 37 possible sub-sequences expected by Example #4

<p>
  In the bottom table, we see each possible sub-sequence of lenght 1 or 2.  Also included are all subsequences where the step from one index to the next is equal.
  For example, for count #37 d[9] = 2 and d[10] = 3.  A step size of 1.  d[11] and d[12] continue this pattern, but d[13] breaks it.  Therefore
  we include the subsequence from d[9] to d[12].
