    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  First, a disclaimer.  The given code works, but fails one of the timing tests.  The constraints are that the solution
  must complete in under 2 seconds.  The code above passes all the tests except test #32.  It give the correct answer, but
  takes about 25 seconds to complete.  I've tried a few techniques to bring this time down without success.  If you've got
  any ideas, I'd like to hear them.
</p>

<p>
  The solution uses a technique know as dynamic programming.  Here, we'll solve for the last element in the array; and then
  using what we've computed, work backward toward the beginning of the array.  I'll explain how it works, by walking through
  an example.
</p>

<p>
  For test3, the input array is { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 } and goodValue = 12.
</p>

<p>
  The idea is to start at the right side of the array, and only consider elements or products that are factors of goodValue.
  Items matching our criteria are stored in a Collection of Lists of Integers called possibleGoodSubsets.  So starting at 12:
  12 is a factor of 12, so add it to possibleGoodSubsets.  11, 10, 9, 8, and 7 are not factors of 12, so we skip past those.
</p>

<p>
  6 is a factor of 12, so add that.  However 6 * 12 = 72 which is not a factor, so we don't add 6,12 to the List.
</p>

<p>
  5 is not a factor, so skip it.  4 is a factor, so we'll add it just like 6 was.
<p>
  
<p>
  3 is a factor of 12.  Also 4 is already in our list, and 3 * 4 = 12 is a factor, so we'll add not only 3; but also 3,4
</p>

<p>
  The table below shows how possibleGoodSubsets grows as we work backward through the array.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>possibleGoodSubsets</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>{{12}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}, {4}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}, {4}, {3,4}, {3}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}, {4}, {3,4}, {3}, {6,2}, {3,2}, {2}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>{{12}, {6}, {4}, {3,4}, {3}, {6,2}, {3,2}, {2}, {12,1}, {6,1}, {4,1}, {3,4,1}, {3,1}, {6,2,1}, {3,2,1}, {2,1}, {1}}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The collection given at Value 1 is what will be returned to the numOfSubsets() method.  It then looks for elements whose product
  equals goodValue.  In this case {{12}, {3,4}, {6,2}, {12,1}, {3,4,1}, {6,2,1}}
</p>

<p>
  This works great so long as not too many elements of the input array are factors of goodValue.  In test32 all 100 of the items
  in the input array are factors, and many of those number, when multiplied together produce factors.  So the size of possibleGoodSubsets
  really explodes in that case.
</p>

<p>
  One thing I noticed when profiling the code was this it was spending most of its time computing the products.  To alieviate this,
  I introduced the class ListAndProduct so that I could store a List of Integers and it's product together, and thus avoid
  having to calculate the product of that list over and over again.  Unfortunately, the effectiveness of that chage was minimal.
</p>

<p>
  I think this is a good algorithm, and does a good job of illustrating techniques of dynamic programming.  So, I'm not really
  interested in re-writing it.  But, if you have ideas that can help get this under the 2 second limit for the worst case scenarios,
  I'd like to hear it.
