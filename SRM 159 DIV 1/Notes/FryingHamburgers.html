        of burgers, and the size of a grill.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
    This is the sort of nasty little problem that you might encounter during a programming
    interview.  I've seen it asked with 3 burgers and a grill that holds two.  That's easy
    enough to explain.  Coding it up for the general case is quite a bit trickier.  It's
    also very likely that you'll pass the given examples, and then fail during the challenge
    phase, since it's so easy to make a mistake in the logic that goes undetected.
</p>

    <p>
        There are essentially five cases to think about:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>hamburgers == 0.  This is trivial, if there are no burgers, it takes no time</li>
        <li>hamburgers <= panSize.  Again, pretty trivial.  We can put all burgers on the pan at once.  Flip them after 5 minutes, and they'll be done in 10.
          There's no way to shorten this.</li>
        <li>(hamburgers % panSize) == 0.  The number of burgers divides evenly by the panSize.  Similar to the above case, but we repeat the process until
        all hamburgers are gone.</li>
        <li>Here's out special case.  If the remainder of the burgers when divided by the pan size is <= half the pans size: (hamburgers % panSize) <= (panSize / 2),
          then we can use a trick.  We flip over half the burgers, set the other half of the burgers aside, and fill the pan with a new set of burgers.
          This can save us the time it takes to cook one side of a burgers.</li>
        <li>Failing the above cases, we fall back to the number of burgers divided by the size of the pan times how long it takes to cook a burger.
    </ol>
