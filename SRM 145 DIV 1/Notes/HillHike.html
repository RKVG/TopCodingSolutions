    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Determine the number of possible paths over a hill. At each step, you
        may go up, down, or stay level. You must reach the maximum height and
        a number of landmarks in between.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

    <p>There are two important concepts on display here. The first is
        determining the number of paths to the finish given a set of parameters.
        The second is storing those values so that they do not need to be
        recalculated over and over. You can get by on small input sets without
        storing the calculated values, but you will fail at least one of the tests
        due to the 2 second time limit.</p>
    <p>The general approach goes like this: The number of paths to the finish
        equals the number of successful paths if the next point is a climb, plus the
        number of paths if the next point is the same height, plus the number of
        paths if the next point is a descent. We'll recursively call
        getPaths() on each of these three points and add them together. At each
        point, if our current height equals the maximum height, then we'll set
        maxHeightReached to true. Also, if our current height equals the
        height of the next landmark, then we'll check that off and begin looking for
        the next landmark. When we reach the finish (distance == maxDistance),
        then we'll check to see if all the conditions have been met.</p>
    <p>First, look at the getPaths() method beginning on line 41. Lines 45-57
        perform some rudimentary checks to see if it's even possible to
        reach the finish given the input. If we're already past the maximum
        distance, gone over the maximum height, too high given the forward distance,
        cannot possibly get back down to a height of zero in the remaining distance,
        of if our height is zero and we're not at either the start or finish; then
        the are no possible paths - return 0.</p>
    <p>Once we've passed all of these checks, lines 63-66 determine if
        we've already calculated the number of paths given these inputs. If we
        have, then just return that number and we skip the trouble of recalculating.
        It's important that we check the out of bounds conditions in the
        previous paragraph first, as this will prevent
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions. This can happen if for example, we
        check for a height above the maximum height.</p>
    <p>On line 66, we'll get back a -1 if the path from here has not you been
        calculated.</p>
    <p>Lines 76-80 check to see if we've reach the end and have met
        all the conditions. We've reached the maximum height at least once.
        We've passed through all the landmarks, and we've reached distance ==
        maxDistance at height == 0. If all these are true, then return 1 -
        otherwise, return 0. If we haven't reached maxDistance yet, then we'll
        continue on and calculate the number of paths from here.</p>
    <p>On Line 82, we set seenMaxHeight to be true if we've been at maxHeight
        previously, or are at it now.</p>
    <p>Lines 91-95 check the height of the next expected landMark.
        If we're at the height of that next land mark, then we increment
        newLandMarksSeen. That way we'll begin looking for the next land mark
        height - or if newLandMarksSeen equals the number of land marks, then we
        know we've seen all of them.</p>
    <p>Lines 98-110 recursively call getPaths() using the next distance,
        and points that are higher then, equal to, and lower than the current point.
        The sum of all these paths becomes the number of paths from the
        current point to the finish. We'll store that value at line 110 so
        that it does not need to be calculated again.</p>
    <p>With this setup, we can call getPaths() from the first point 0,0 and it will
        calculate all possible paths from the start to the finish that meet the
        constraints of the problem.</p>
    <p>The inner class PathCache at line 120 stores the number of paths given the
        inputs. This technique is know as memoization and it comes in very
        handy in this case. By storing values that we've seen before, we can
        eliminate the need to calculate the same subtrees over and over again.</p>
    <p>On line 129, a 4 dimensional array is created. This allows any possible
        combination of distance, height, number of land marks seen, and max height
        seen to be mapped to a long - which is the number of paths from that point.
        Initially these are all set to -1, so a value of 0 or more denotes a
        number that has already been calculated.</p>
    <p>The distance and height dimensions are 1 unit larger than the need to be, bu
        t this prevents having to do some -1 calculations in other places. The
        size of the numLandMarks dimension must be one larger than the number of
        landmarks to protect against the case where the number of landmarks is zero.
        We always want at least one unit here. The final dimension maps
        to the boolean maxHeightReached. Here true gets location 1 and false
        is location 0.</p>
    <p>If you're unconvinced about the need to store the previously calculated
        paths, please try this: Run test 4 from the topcoder arena with the
        code as is. For me, it took about 7ms to complete. Now comment
        out lines 66 and replace it with "return -1". This
        essentially forces every path to be calculated as if it weren't cached.
        My time is now... we'll it's been running for more than 10 minutes, so
        I'll let you know when it completes.</p>
