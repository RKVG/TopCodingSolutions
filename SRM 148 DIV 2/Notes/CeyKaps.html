    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

    <p>I found this problem to be a bit tricky to understand. My first thought was to use a HashMap to map the key caps to their underlying values. This is probably the way to go, but I never did get the keys and values to work out right.</p>

    <p>This solution uses an array instead to hold the mappings. Lines 17-23 create the array and initialize it.</p>

    <p>The swaps are handled on lines 29-53. First it gets the characters, and then beginning on line 43 searches through the array to find the positions that hold those two characters. Once the positions are known, the values at those two positions are swapped.</p>

    <p>Finally, it creates a new array to hold the return value, and maps each character in "typed" to its corresponding value in "keys". (I believe here is where my HashMap idea was failing). The "result" array is converted to a String and returned.</p>
