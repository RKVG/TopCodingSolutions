    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  Be careful that you call the function exactly 200,000 times when stabilizing it, and exactly 1,000 times when determining the high and low values.  An off-by-one error will affect the results of some tests.
</p>

<p>
  Also, be sure that you set the initial range values correctly.  After stabilizing, the first call to the function will give you both the max and min values.  Then, continue through the remaining 999 calls updating the max and min as appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, make sure that your function is correct.  It doesn't explicitly state it in the problem statement, but the function you want to use is the one given in the sample: F(X) = R * X * (1 -X)
