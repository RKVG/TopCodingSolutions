    <div class="header">Overview:</div>

        Given an initial state, determine the number of tire rotations needed
        to reach the current state.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        There's just two things to take care of to solve this problem, both of
        which are very easy.  First, write a method that performs the tire
        rotation and returns the results.  And second, loop through the
        rotations until a match is found, or we've exhausted all possible
        configurations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The while loop on line 13 calls rotateTires() and checkes the result.
        The loop terminates when a match is found, or if phase becomes greater
        than 4 - meaning that there is no possible solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rotateTires() method takes a String and returns a new String
        representing the tire pattern after a rotation.  It simply creates
        an array to store the new values, and maps the old positions into
        their proper new place.  Just make sure you map in the right direction
        and offset everything by 1.
