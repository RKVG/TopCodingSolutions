    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
    This is a very easy Divison 2 - 500 point problem, if you let the language
    do all of the hard work.  All you need to do is loop through the
    possible bases, from 2 up to the limit of 20, and check to see if the
    equation is valid.  To be valid, it must not contain any invalid digits
    for the given base, and the equation must be true.
</p>

<p>
    isLegal() begins by splitting the equation up into its two addends and
    it's sum.  This is done easily with the split method on line 34.  The
    parameter "[+=]" causes it to split on both the + and = character, thus
    dividing the equation into three pieces.
</p>

<p>
    Knowing that the Integer class provides a parseInt() method that can
    interpret different bases makes the rest of the problem a piece of cake.
    Just allow it to do its thing, and catch any NumberFormatExceptions that it
    might throw.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, just check to see that that equation evaluates to true.
