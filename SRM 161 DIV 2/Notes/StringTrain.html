    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  The main method buildTrain() simply sets the initial value of the train and then loops through each of the remaining cars, calling processCar() on them.
  All of the hard work is done inside processCar().
  After all the cars have been processed, we note the length of the train, and then call removeAllButLastChar() before returning the results.  
</p>

<p>
  processCar() works by moving through the train string from beginning to end.  The variable trainIdx is the current character in the train string that we're examining.
  carIdx is an index into the car String, and startOfSuffix will hold the position of the beginning of a possible prefix/suffix match.  This is in case the match
  ultimately fails so we can pick up from the next character.
</p>

<p>
  First, processCar() skips over characters in train until it finds one that matches the first
  character of car. If there are no matches before reaching the end of train, then just return train.  Assuming that the first character of car appears
  in train, we mark that location as the beginning of a possible suffix.  Then we walk through both strings one character at a time until we either reach
  the end of one of the Strings, or until the characters no longer match.
</p>

<p>
  If we reach the end of the train string, then we have a possible prefix/suffix match.  Check to make sure that our match does not include the entire
  train or car String, as this would not be a "proper" prefix or suffix.  If that test passes, then we construct the result string by appending the remaining
  characters from car onto the end of train.
</p>

<p>
  If the characters cease to match up, or if we reach the end of the car string, then we reset carIdx back to the beginning of the car String and
  set the trainIdx to the character following where we began the previous prefix/suffix match attempt.  We then continue trying to find a match
  from that point.
</p>

<p>
  With the hard part done, we now turn to removeAllButLastChar().  First we create a Set of characters to hold all of the characters we've seen so far.
  Then there's a StringBuilder to build up our result.
  Next, we'll work backward through the string.  For each chacter, if it exists in the usedChars Set, then skip it.  If it's not in that set, add it, and
  then add that character to the front of our StringBuilder.
