    </p>

    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Determine the cards that will end up in each players hand after a deck has been delt.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

<p>
  Rather than deal the first card to player one, then the next card to player two, and so on; this solution determines all of the cards
  that will end up in a player's hand before moving on to the next player.
</p>

<p>
  It's simple enough to determine how many cards each player will get, just divide the length of the deck by the number of players.  The division
  operator rounds down, which ensures that all players get the same number of cards without needing more cards than there are in the deck.
</p>

<p>
  The outer-most for loop loops through each of the players.  For each player, their first card will be in position i.  Then we just add
  each card that is numPlayers further down in the deck until the player has the correct number of cards.  Each card is added to a StringBuffer, which
  gets converted into a String and added to the appropriate place in the hands[] array.
