    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

<p>
  The simple formula for the area of a triangle (A = (b * h) / 2) won't help us much.  Instead we use a formula like the one given
  <a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/coordtrianglearea.html">here</a>
</p>

<p>
  The area of the polygon can be calculated by dividing it up into triangles.  For a polygon with n points, the area is the sum
  of the triangles formed by the points {0,1,2} + {0,2,3} + ... {0,n-1,n}.  This becomes obvious is you draw any convex polygon
  on a piece of paper.
</p>

<p>
  An alternate approach is to carve off a triangle (and calculate its area), and then recursively call findArea() to get the area
  of the remaining polygon.
