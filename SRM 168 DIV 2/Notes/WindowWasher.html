    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
The idea is to start with a building of width w == 1, and add columns until w == width.  Each
new column will be assigned to the washer that can complete it the earliest.  The assignedColumns[]
array will hold the index of the washer assigned to that column.  Note that at this point, the height
of the building doesn't matter, and we can ignore the constraint that the washers cannot cross each
other, since we're really just trying to determine the number of columns that each washer will do.
</p>

<p>
The method calcCompletionTimes() determines the time the each washer could complete the next column,
taking into consideration all columns that the washer already has assigned to them.  For example,
if a washer has no columns assigned, then it's just the time that it takes the washer to do a column.
If there are other columns assigned, we sum the time it takes to complete those, and add that to
the time it takes to complete the column.
</p>

<p>
For our purpose here, it's safe to assume that all columns have a height 1.  That is, if a window washer
could complete a column of of height 1 before another washer; then they could complete the column
earlier if the height had any other value.
</p>

<p>
After calculating the completion times, the loop on line 35 simply identifies the washer that could complete
the column the earliest, and assigns it to them.
</p>

<p>
Once we've worked up to the entire width of the building, we just need to look for the washer that would
complete their work last.  This part is pretty trivial.  We just have an array that holds the completion
times for each washer.  Then work through each of the assignedColumns, and increment the washer's
completion time by the time it takes them to complete the column - all the while keeping track of the
maximum completion time.
