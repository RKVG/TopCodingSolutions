    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Count the number of strides it takes to get up several flights of stairs.
    </p>


    <div class="header">Java Source:</div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>
     1	public class StairClimb {
     2	
     3	        public int stridesTaken(int[] flights, int stairsPerStride) {

    13	            * If the last stride does not end evenly at the landing,
    14	            * then we'll need one more stride.
    15	            */
    16	            if (flights[f] % stairsPerStride != 0) totalStrides++;
    17	
    18	            // Add the two steps to turn at the landing.
    19	            totalStrides += 2;
    20	        }
    21	
    22	        // We don't need to count the turn at the top.  Remove those strides.
    23	        totalStrides -= 2;
    24	
    25	        return (totalStrides < 0) ? 0 : totalStrides;
    26	    }
    27	}
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
	Start with totalStrides equal to zero.  Then for each flight of stairs, do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>Get the whole number of strides that fits into this flight of stairs.</li>
			<li>If there are any remaining stairs, add one more stride to cover those.</li>
			<li>Add two strides to make the turn at the landing.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, remove two strides because we don't need to count the strides on the last landing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, make sure that we don't return less than 0.  This could happen if the
		length of the flights array was 0.
	</p>
