        Determine an employee's compensation for the day. Rates vary for evening
        and night shifts.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The first thing to note is that you want to avoid using decimals. If you
        introduce doubles, you'll waste a ton of time tracking
        down off-by-one errors. To get around this, we simply double each second
        as we count it: A day shift second counts as 2; and an
        evening or night shift second will count as 3. Then, when the result is
        calculated, the number of seconds in an hour is also
        doubled to compensate.
    </p>

    <p>
        The approach taken is to examine each second of the shift, and determine
        if it falls during the day shift hours or evening/night. The
        method convertTimeToSeconds() will give the number of seconds since the
        start of the day. We use that to set two markers; the
        start of the day shift and the end of the day shift. Then we loop
        through each of the shifts, and each second of each shift and
        compare that seconds agains the markers. The counter
        effectiveSecondsWorked is the incremented by either 2 or 3.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the effective total number of seconds is know, we multiple that by
        the wage, and divide by ther number of seconds in an hour times 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        An alternative approach would be to determine the number of seconds in a
        shift by subtracting the start time from the end time. If a
        shift spans a night/day or day/evening boundary, then it would need to
        be broken into two (or more) segments. I had a solution using this
        approach about 99% done, but found a few tests that were off by 1 or 2.
        Frustrated, I re-wrote the solution using the current approach.
