    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        I've created a class Team the implements Comparable so that we can use Java's built-in sort capabilities.
        All the logic necessary for sorting the teams is contained in the Team.compareTo() method.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that, it's just a matter of creating the team objects, and adding their finishing places.  Lines 67-70
        create an array of teams and assign each one it's name.  Then the loop on lines 79-82 works through each of
        the letters in finishOrder and calls addFinisher() on the corresponding team.  We can get the correct team
        by subtracting 'A' from the current letter.  For example, if the letter is 'C', the 'C' - 'A' = 2, which
        is the position in the teams array of team C.
    </p>

    <p>
        The addFinisher() method handles the logic of determining if this runner's score counts toward the team's
        score (it's a top 5 runner), or if we should store this score in tieBreaker (if it's the 6th runner for
        that team).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once all the team data is populated, we add only those teams with 5 or more runners to the qualifyingTeams
        list, sort the list, and then add each team's name in order to the string that we return.
    </p>
