    <p>
        Find the card which completes the pattern.  For each group of characteristics, the matching card
        must either share the trait with the other two cards, or all three cards must have a different value.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        This is one of those problems where reading the description makes you think it's going to be much more
        difficult than the problem actually is.  All we need to do is for each of the four traits (shape, color,
        fill pattern, and count) give the value of the string if the first and second card have the same value.  Or,
        if the first and second cards have different values, then we give the third (or odd man out) value.
    </p>

    <p>
        The for loop in the findMatch() method just walks through each of the four traits, and calls getMatch() to
        insert the correct value into the result array.
    </p>

    <p>
        getMatch() compares the two strings, and if they're equal returns that value.  Otherwise, it looks through
        the values given in traits for a string that does not match s1 and does not match s2.  Note that we should
        never reach the return null statement on line 37, but it needs to be there to satisfy the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing difficult here.  Getting through the description actually took longer than writing the code.
