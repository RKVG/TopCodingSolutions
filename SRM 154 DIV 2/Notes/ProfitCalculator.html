    </p>

    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Calculate the profit margin given an array of items.

<pre>
01: public class ProfitCalculator {
02: 
03:     public int percent(String[] items) {

06:         float totalCustCost = 0f;

12:             String[] costs = s.split(" ");
13: 
14:             totalCustCost += Float.parseFloat(costs[0]);
15:             totalStoreCost += Float.parseFloat(costs[1]);

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
      Not much to this problem.  totalCustCost and totalStoreCost are created to keep a running total of the
      customer and stores costs.  We loop through each of the items in the input array, and update the totals
      as each item is processed.  At the end just use the formulat ((customer cost - store cost ) / customer cost) * 100
      to get the final profit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When processing each item, the String method split() is used to divide the customer and store portions.  Then
      Float.parseFloat() is used to convert the string representation into a float.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The return value must be an int, so we must cast this since a float to an int could lose precision.  However,
      fortunately, that's just what the problem statement calls for.
