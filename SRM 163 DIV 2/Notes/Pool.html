    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  The first thing I did was to create an enumerated type to represent the three types of billiard
  balls: Solid, Stripe, and 8-ball.  It seemed easier to work with just these three and avoid
  having to deal with the individual values of the balls.  With that, I created an array of
  legal rack configurations.  Note that the legal racks are inverses of each other.  Looking
  back, I probably could have made better use of that fact.
</p>

<p>
  Next, I define an inner class called SearchNode.  This holds a rack configuration, the number
  of moves required to reach this state, and some code to count the number of balls that are out
  of place, and to swap balls - leading to a new configuration.  The method getPriority() gives
  us an idea of how good the current state is.  The fewer balls out of place, and the less
  moves needed to reach this state, the better.
</p>

<p>
  The swapBalls() method first looks to see if the 8 ball is in position 4.  If it's not, then we'll
  swap the ball in position 4 with the 8 ball.  Otherwise, we look for the first ball that is
  out of position (i.e. a Stripe where a Solid belongs).  Then we look for an opposing ball
  to swap with that.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, the SearchNode class provides a compareTo() method.  The algorithm uses a priority
  queue to examine the SearchNode with the lowest priority.  The compareTo() method allows
  SearchNodes to be sorted.
</p>

<p>
  The heart of the algorithm is in the while loop of the rackMoves() method.  It's based on
  the A* algorithm.  We start by placing the initial state into the priority queue.  Then
  we remove the lowest priority state from the queue and add two new states representing
  steps toward one of the two legal end states.
</p>

<p>
  Once we've found a state that is legal, we update minNumberOfMoves.  Any state that cannot
  reach the end state in less moves will not be added to the priority queue, and that line of
  progression will terminate.
</p>

<p>
  Once the queue is empty, we'll have found our minimum possible number of moves.
</p>

<p>
  This solution is probably overkill given the problem.  With only 15 balls, and noting
  that each swap (not including the 8 ball) brings two more balls into alignment, it shouldn't
  be hard to write a brute-force approach.  I like this solution becase it is more general.
  It can be expanded to take any starting condition and find the best sequence to get
  to any ending state.  The same algorithm can be used to solve a rubik's cude, those sliding
  tile games, or a host of other problems.
