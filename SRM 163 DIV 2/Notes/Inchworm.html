    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Count the number of leaves an inchworm will stop at and eat before making
        it's way to the end of a branch.
    </p>


    <div class="header">Java Source:</div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>
01: public class Inchworm {
02: 
03:     public int lunchtime(int branch, int rest, int leaf) {
04: 
05:         int meals = 0;
06: 
07:         for (int p = 0; p <= branch; p += rest) {
08:             if ((p % leaf) == 0) meals++;
09:         }
10: 
11:         return meals;
12:     }

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  This is a simple problem that can be solved in less time that it takes to read the description.
</p>

<p>
  We'll use the variable <strong>p</strong> to keep track of the inchworm's current position.  This starts at zero, and get
  incremented by <strong>rest</strong> until the inchworm goes beyond the end of the branch.
</p>

<p>
  At each position, we'll check to see if there's a leaf there, and if so, increment the number of meals eaten.  We can tell
  if there is a leaf at the current position by using the % operator.  If position is evenly divided by leaf, then we've stopped
  on a leaf.
</p>

<p>
  Once <strong>p</strong> is greater than <strong>branch</strong> we can return the value in meals.
</p>
