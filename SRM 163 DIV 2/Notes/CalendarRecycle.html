        Determine the next year that shares a calendar with the given year.  That
        is, all dates fall on the same day of the week.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  We say that two calendars are the same if the meet the following conditions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any date falls on the same day of the week.  (i.e. Jan 1 is a Sunday for both years). and</li>
  <li>Both years have the same leap year status.  Either both are, or both aren't leap years.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The first thing useAgain() does is store the leap year status of the current year.  We'll need this
  later to check that it matches the status of the candidate year.
</p>

</p>
  Next, we set dayOfWeek to it's initial value.  Note that we don't care what day this represents.  It
  could be Sunday, Monday, etc.  The only thing that matters is that we return to this value.
<p>
  
<p>
  Finally, it's just a matter of adding 365 (+1 if it's a leap year), mod'ing that by 7 and seeing if
  we're back to the starting day.  If so, and the leap year status matches, we've found our answer.
</p>

<p>
  The logic for isLeapYear() is taken directly from the problem description.  First check to see if
  the year is divisible by 4.  If so, then check to see if it's not divisible by 100, unless it is
  also divisible by 400.
</p>

<p>
  I've provided an alternate solution in useAgain1() that makes use of Java's GregorianCalendar.
</p>

<p>
  Here, we create a new GregorianCalenar for January 1st of the given year (any date could have been chosen),
  and remember its day of the week.  Then we keep adding a year and checking the day of the week and leap year
  status just as before.
</p>

<p>
  An interesting note about GregorianCalendar - it provides an instance method isLeapYear(int year).  A better
  way would be to create a static method GregorianCalendar.isLeapYear(int year) that could give the result for
  any year; and also provide an instnace method isLeapYear() with no parameters that gives the status of the
  current object.  With the chosen implementation, you must create an instance of the GregorianCalendar to
  get the leap year status of some year that may be unrelated to that object.  The second half of useAgain2()'s if
  statement could be much cleaner as:
</p>

<code>GregorianCalendar.isLeapYear(year) == c.isLeapYear()</code>
