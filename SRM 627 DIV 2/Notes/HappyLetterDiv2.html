    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  In order to be a happy letter, more than half the letters in the string must be that character.  If the frequency
  of a character is half (or less) the length of the input string, then other characters can be paired up
  with the current character until all instances of the current character are eliminated.  Conversely, if the frequency
  is greater than half, then matching all other characters with the current character will be insufficient to eliminate all
  of the current character.
</p>

<p>
  The solution then is just to loop through all the characters in the input string.  For each letter, count the
  number of times it appears, and if that's greater than half the size of the input string, return it as the
  happy letter. If no character meets that criteria, return '.'
</p>

<p>
  Note that only one character can be a happy letter, because more than half the input string must consist of that character.
  It's impossible for more than one character to take up more than half the string.
