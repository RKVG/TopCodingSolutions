    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
    Surprisingly easy for a Division 1 problem.  All you need to do is look at the current, and previous
    2 rounds played by your opponent.
</p>

<p>
  If the current, 1st previous, and 2nd previous rounds all match then we'll win.  We see the first
  two come in the same, and guess that the third will be the same, so we play whatever beats it.
</p>

<p>
  If the current, 1st previous, and 2nd previous are all different, we will win here too.  After
  seeing that the last two don't match, we'll play whatever beats the 3rd object.
</p>

<p>
  In the first two rounds, we always play Rock.  So if the opponent plays Scissors we win there too.
</p>
 
<p>
  That's all there is to it.
