    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The solution formats the dollars and cents portions separately, and then combines the together to form the return value.
    </p>

    <p>
        Really the only tricky part is inserting the commas into the proper place in the dollars portion.  This is handled by the for loop beginning at line 27.  First, the variable count is initialized to 0.  Then, the for loop works from right to left counting and inserting characters into a StringBuilder.  When three characters have been seen, a comma is inserted, and count is set back to 0.  If we're at the left-most position in the string, then the comma insertion is skipped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Formatting the cents portion is even easier.  There's a while loop that adds 0's on the beginning of the number until it's at least 2 wide.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, the main method amount() combines the two, adding a "." between them, and prefixing the entire string with a "$"
