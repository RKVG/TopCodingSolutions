    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        You are asked to decode a string. The original String is in binary format.
        The encoded string is formed by adding both neighboring digits to the
        current digit.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The toughest part of this problem is determining how to calculate the
        value at the current location of the return String - Line 38. I suggest
        you write this out on paper to see how it works. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>message:</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>return:</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>?</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>
        The value of the ? will be one space back in the message array (3) -
        one space back in the return array (1) - two spaces back in the
        return array (1). 3 - 1 - 1 = 1. These values are calculated on lines
        50, 51, and 54.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you insert 1 for the ?, you'll see that the encoding/decoding of
        the message is correct up to that point.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next position in the return array must be 0, since the 2 is already
        the total the 1 (at the ? location) and 1 (one space before the ?).
    </p>
