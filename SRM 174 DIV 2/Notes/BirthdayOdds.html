        Calculate the mininum number of people required to assure that the probability of two people sharing a
        birthday meets the given threshold.  The number of days in a year may vary.

    <p>
        For a detailed discussion of the Birthday Problem, see the wikipedia entry
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">here</a>.  This solution is based
        on the formula given in the "Calculating the probability" section.
    </p>

    <p>
        Essentially we're calculating the probability that there is <strong>not</strong> a match, and then adding more
        and more people thus reducing that probability until a certain threshold is met.  That threshold
        is (1 - minOdds) since we're calculating the probability of not matching whereas minOdds is the
        probability of a match.
    </p>

    <p>
        pA begins at 1 (i.e. daysInYear / daysInYear), then is multiplied by (daysInYear - 1 / daysInYear),
        (daysInYear - 2 / daysInYear), (daysInYear - 3 / daysInYear), ...  With each multiplication pA gets smaller
        until it falls under the cutoff.
