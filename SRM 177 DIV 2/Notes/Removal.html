        Remove items from a list filling in the space by shifting all following elements up one.  Return
        the item at the given position after all the removals.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        You might assume that you could use a built-in data structure, such as a linked list to solve the problem.
        Just initialize the list, and then let it do the removals for you.  However, it pays to take a look at
        the constraints first.  The number of elements can be up to 2,000,000,000 which is way too much to fit into
        the allotted 64MB.
    </p>

    <p>
        The solution is to think about how k's position changes as elements in front of it are removed.  Elements
        that are greater than k don't matter when they're removed since these won't affect k's position.
    </p>

    <p>
        We start at the end work backwards through each String in remove.  First, parse out the lo and hi elements of
        the string.  Then, if lo is less than k, we'll adjust k's position accordingly.  The number of elements removed
        is given by (hi - lo + 1).  So, we increase k's value by that amount to get it's position before
        the removals.
    </p>

    <p>
        After working backward through all the elements in remove, the value of k will be it's original starting
        position which is the value we want to return.
    </p>

    <p>
        Be careful to check the value of k after each addition.  If it's ever greater than n, we'll return -1.  The
        addition could also cause an overflow.  You could convert k to a long to prevent this, or just check the
        value to see if it becomes negative.  Since the value of hi will be 2 billion or less, it will fit into
        an int.  Adding 2 billion to a positive int and causing an overflow will always result in a negative number.
