    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Count the number of combinations of risers and treads that can lead to a staircase of the given dimensions.
    </p>

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        Note that the size of both the risers and treads must be integers, and that they are at most 1,000. This means
        that a brute force search is certainly possible. We'll loop through all possible heights and count the number
        of configurations that are possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each riser height, we first check to see if it evenly divides the total height. If not, then we can
        continue on with the next height. If so, then we'll look at the treads.
    </p>

    <p>
        The number of treads will be one less than the number of risers. We can compute the number of risers with
        (totalHeight / riserHeight). Then just subtract one from that result to get the number of treads.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, we look for ways to discount the current number of risers and treads.  The problem statement says that
        their must be at least one tread (and riser), so we can throw out any cases where the number of treads is
        0.  Again, just like with the risers, the total width must be evenly divided by the number of treads, so we can
        skip any case where that isn't true.  And finally, any case where the width of each tread
        (totalWidth / numTreads) is smaller than the minimum allowed can also be skipped.
    </p>

    <p>
        Passing each of those tests, leaves us with a valid configuration, so increment the counter.  After looping
        throug all possibilities, return the value in the counter.
    </p>
