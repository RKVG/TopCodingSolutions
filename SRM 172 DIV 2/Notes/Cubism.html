    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        This problem becomes very easy once you break it down into smaller steps.  The first task
        is to take the unwieldly String[] and convert it into an easy to use 3 dimensional array
        of chars.  This is handled on lines 15-23.  Nothing trick here, except for a little bit
        of math to get the right character out of the String.
    </p>

    <p>
        With our 3-D array, we can now loop through each position and count the number of lines
        starting at that position.  Note that we'll count each row twice.  Once starting from
        each end and going to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
        The countLinesStartingAt() method does just that.  Given a 3-D coordinate, it returns
        the number of lines starting from that position.  Rather than writing out the 27 directions
        that we could move out from for any given position, I have three nested loops and the
        variables deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ.  Each of these variables moves from -1 to 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that, we call isLine() providing the staring point, direction, and color.  isLine()
        just checks that we stay within the confines of the cube and stay on the correct color
        as we move along the line.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nothing really difficult here.  It could probably have been a Division 2 Level 2.
