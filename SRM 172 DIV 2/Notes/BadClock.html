        Determine how many hours it will take a clock to show the correct time given how
        far off it is initially and how many seconds it gains/loses per hour.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The first step is to determine how many seconds the skewed clock is away from the true time.  This
        is calculated on lines 18-27 and is stored in skewSeconds.  Note that if skewSeconds is positive
        then the skewed clock is behind true time.  If skewSeconds is negative, then the skewed clock is
        ahead of the true time.
    </p>

    <p>
        If skewSeconds is 0, then we can simply return 0.  Otherwise, we'll want to divide the number of seconds
        the two clocks are off by the hourlyGain.  This is fine if the skewed clock is ahead and hourlyGain is
        negative; or if the skewed clock is behin and hourlyGain is positive.  But we must account for two other
        cases as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the skewed clock is ahead, and the hourlyGain is positive, then it's distance ahead will keep increasing.
        To fix this, we can just set the skewed clock back 12 hours.  Similary, if the skewed clock is behind, and
        the hourlyGain is negative, we can adjust the skewed clock ahead 12 hours.  Be careful with the signs here,
        it can get a little confusing.
