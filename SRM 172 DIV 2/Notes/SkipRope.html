    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The solution starts by creating an array (heights) to store the two closest numbers.  It sets
        their initial values to Integer.MAX_VALUE to ensure they're far enough away from our height
        that the first two numbers seen are guaranteed to be closers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then we make one pass through the list of candidate heights.  If the height is closer than
        the value in position 0, we move the closest into the second closest position, and insert
        our candidate in position 0 as the next closest height.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the height is not the closest, but it is closer than the second closest, then we simply
        replace the the height in position 1 with our current candidate's height.
    </p>

    <p>
        The method isCloser determines if the value is candidate is closer to height than the value of
        current.  Note that we must take the absolute value of the difference.  In the event of  a tie
        closer is determined by if candidate is greater than current.
