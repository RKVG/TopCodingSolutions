    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The problem can be solved by breaking it up into two pieces.  First, obviously we're going
        to need a method to determine if a character is a consonant or vowel.  This is
        handled by isVowel().  isVowel() first converts the character to upper-case, and then
        compares it to the standard vowels A, E, I, O, and U.  If it matches one of these, or if
        it doesn't and also is not a 'Y' then we're done.  'Y's are the only tricky letter.
    </p>

    <p>
        To determine if 'Y' is a vowel or not, isVowel() requires a boolean denoting whether
        the previous character was a vowel or not.  We can set prevIsVowel's initial value to true
        since the behavior of a 'Y' at the beginning of a string is the same as a 'Y' following
        a vowel.
    </p>

    <p>
        With a reliable method of determining consonants and vowels, we just need to construct
        the return String, and the only challenge there is eliminating duplicates.  One way
        to do this would be to keep track of the last character, and only append the next
        character if it differed.  An easier way is to just add all the characters, and
        then use a regular expression to remove the duplicates.  This is done in the
        replaceAll() method of the return statement.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're not familiar with the assignment on line 10, all this does is assign the
        result of isVowel() to both prevIsVowel and cvArray[i] in one line.  First, isVowel()
        is evaluated and the result is assigned to prevIsVowel.  The result of this assignment,
        which is either true or false, is then assigned to cvArray[i].  With that, we've
        put the correct character (either a 'V' or a 'C') into the array, and set prevIsVowel
        to the correct value for the next call into isVowel().
