        Count the number of peaks in a series of integers.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  First, check the special cases where the length of heights is either 0 or 1.  Now that we know the length of heights must be
  at least 2, we having to check that our index is in bounds.
</p>

<p>
  We check to see if the left edge is a peak, and then check the right edge.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, we loop through each of the values in between.  Not much to this problem.
