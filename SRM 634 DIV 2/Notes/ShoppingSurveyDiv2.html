    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Given a count of how many of each item was purchased, and the number
        of customers, determine the smallest number of customers that could
        have purchased one of each item.
    </p>


    <div class="header">Java Source:</div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>
01: public class ShoppingSurveyDiv2 {
02: 
03:     public int minValue(int N, int[] s) {
04: 
05:         int numItemsPurchased = 0;
06: 
07:         for (int i : s) {
08:             numItemsPurchased += i;
09:         }
10: 
11:         int maxItemsPurchasedWithNoBigShoppers = (s.length - 1) * N;
12: 
13:         int numBigShoppers =
14:                 numItemsPurchased - maxItemsPurchasedWithNoBigShoppers;
15: 
16:         return (numBigShoppers < 0) ? 0 : numBigShoppers;
17: 
18:     }
19: }
</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  First, we'll count the total number of items that have been purchased.  This is stored in the variable numItemsPurchased.
</p>

<p>
  Next, we calculate the number of items that could be purchased if every customer stopped just short of buying one of each.  That is
  each customer, buys (s.length -1) items.  We'll call that maxItemsPurchasedWithNoBigShoppers.
</p>

<p>
  The number of BigShoppers that we'll need is now just the difference between numItemsPurchased and maxItemsPurchasedWithNoBigShoppers.
  This value may be negative, in which case we'll return zero.
</p>

<p>
  This problem is a bit difficult to understand, but once you get it, the code is really easy.
