<p>
    This site is dedicated to helping others learn how to solve problems by writing code. As I work through the
    challenges found in the TopCoder Arena, I'll post my solutions - complete with comments and a full description. My
    hope is that by reviewing the source code and the notes sections, you will gain an understanding of the approach I
    took in solving the problem.
</p>

<p>
    Each solution will be posted first in Java, and then additional languages as time allows. However, in most cases,
    the language used doesn't really matter. None of the solutions require a deep understanding of the programming
    language itself. There are other sites that teach the ins and outs of programming languages. This site is focused on
    how to solve problems.</p>
</p>

<p>If you've never tried the TopCoder Arena, I highly recommend it. Visit
    <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank">http://www.topcoder.com</a>. The arena can be found under the
    Challenges drop-down menu. I'll be focusing on the Single-Round-Matches (SRM). These matches are held roughly every
    week or two - however, you are free to practice with any of the past matches.</p>

<p>
    As per the TopCoder terms and conditions, I will not include the problem statement itself. Instead, I'll provide a
    link (i.e. <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=1704" target="_blank">SRM 144 DIV 1 -
    300 points</a>). You'll need to visit the TopCoder site to get the details.
</p>

<p>
    Unless otherwise noted, each solution will have passed all of the test cases that are run by the TopCoder Arena upon
    submission.
</p>

<p>
    I do not claim that these are the best solutions. They are certainly not the most compact. Coding for a competition
    requires a different style than coding for "the real world". Often the submissions that score the highest points are
    very quick and dirty - making them very difficult to learn from. In fact, since one phase of the match allows
    competitors to challenge other competitor's code - it is in the coder's best interest not to make their solution
    understandable. I'll strive to make my solutions as easy to understand as possible.
</p>

<p>
    Each of these solutions represents my own original work. That being said, I'd like to acknowledge the
    <a href="http://apps.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Algorithm+Problem+Set+Analysis" target="_blank">TopCoder Match
        Editorials</a>. The descriptions found there have been helpful on those occasions when I needed a hint to get me
    moving in the right direction. Feel free to link to this site, but please don't copy the code or notes without
    giving credit.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I encourage you to leave feedback if you have any questions, comments, or if you found anything
    particularly helpful.
