    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>The heart of this algorithm is in the loop in lines 105-126. Here, we start with the smallest section. There are three possibilities:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The smallest section contains just enough links to join all of the remaining sections. Line 111. We subtract 1 from the number of sections because we don't need to count the smallest one itself. In this case, we cut all links in the shortest chain and use them to join the longer sections.</li>
	<li>The smallest section contains more than enough links to join all the remaining sections. Line 114. Here, we cut smallest sections as many times as needed to join all of the remaining sections.</li>
	<li>The smallest sections does not contain enough links to join all the remaining sections. Lines 123-125. Then, we remove one link from the smallest section and use it to join the two largest sections. Then loop back through and repeat the processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a final note, the two returns at lines 113 and 116 should catch every case. The return at line 129 is only needed in order to compile - it's an error if it reaches there.</p>
