    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>This problem requires you to start from the end state and work backwards to reconstruct what the beginning must have looked like. We know from the problem that it started as some point and removed the Kth person. This repeated numFemale times until all the females are gone. So the first hint is that on every move a female is removed, the number of males remains constant.</p>

<p>Lines 19 through 27 create an array large enough to hold all participants, and then inserts the number of males starting at the head of the array.</p>

<p>Now, we reverse the process. Instead of counting ahead and removing a female, we count back and insert a female. Line 48 handles counting back, and the insertFemale() method takes care of inserting the 'F' at the given position and shifting everything beyond that point one spot to the right.</p>

<p>We must be careful because the size of the circle array is not the number of people currently in the circle at that point. Lines 51-53 detect when we've gone in front of the beginning of the array, and set us back to the end based on the number of people.</p>

<p>Finally, we won't necessary end up at the start of the array. So, to construct the return string, we need to concatenate everything to the right of our current position, with everything from the beginning of the the array up to our current position.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>|--A---</td><td></td><td>----------B----------|</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td /><td>^</td><td />
	</tr>
</table>

<p>For some clarity, if our final position is at the ^, then the return string would be B + A.</p>
