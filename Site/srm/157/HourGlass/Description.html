<div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  The first thing to note is that we can only take an action when one (or both) of the hourglasses has emptied.  These types of problems do not allow
  for the possibility of stopping a hourglass at the 1/2 way point, or any other intermediate position.  I'll call the time at which an hourglass empties
  a "Pause".  At these moments, one of four actions can occur.:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nothing.  We don't flip either hourglass.  Instead, just continue until the second one runs out too.</li>
  <li>Flip Hourglass #1</li>
  <li>Flip Hourglass #2</li>
  <li>Flip Both #1 and #2</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Whenever a Pause is reached, we'll recursively call flipHourGlass() for each of these four possibilities.  In each case, the time to the next Pause is
  calculated and added to the total elapsed time. Lines 131 - 173.
</p>

<p>
  The next Pause is calculated by the getNextPause() method which examines the amount of time remaining in each hourglass.  The Pause will occur when the
  smaller of the two runs out - unless the smaller is already at zero.  Care needs to be taken here to ensure that we don't enter an infinite loop by
  choosing to pause at the same state over and over again.
</p>

<p>
  The times that can be calculated are stored in a max PriorityQueue.  Normally this structure ensure that the smallest element is always
  the next to be popped off.  But, by passing Collections.reverseOrdeer() to the constructor, Lines 56-58, we end up with the largest
  element at the top.  So long as the PriorityQueue maxPQ has fewer than 10 elements, we'll add the elapsedTime at every Pause.  Once it holds
  10 elements, then we'll compare the current elapsed time to maxPQ's largest element, and if the current time is smaller, then we'll replace the
  largest with the current time.  In this way, we are assured that the smallest 10 numbers are stored.
</p>

<p>
  Also, the PriorityQueue provides a convienient way of breaking the recursive calls to flipHourGlass().  Once the elapsedTime is greater than the
  largest element stored in maxPQ, there is no sense in continuing.  We can return at that point. Line 101.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I've created a class to represent the hourglasses - GlassTimer.  This object is immutable.  Once created, it's properties cannot be changed.
  Calls to update the ojbect, like flip() and runFor() return new instances of GlassTimer.  This is very useful, and protects against your local
  variables from being modified - especially when using recursion.
</p>

<p>
  Putting it all together, the program enters by calling measurable() at line 61.  flipHourGlasses is called with two new GlassTimers, both filled
  at the top, and an initial elapsedTime of 0.  Once that returns, we'll have a priority quest holding the 10 smallest times.  We pop (poll) the
  largest number off one at a time, and use it to fill in the return array working from back to front.
