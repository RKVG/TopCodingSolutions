    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

<p>
  For any given pattern X (where X represents any number of stripes) a new pattern xX (where x is one additional stripe to the left side of X) can be
  created with just 1 more stroke than the number of strokes neeeded to create X.  We'll use this as an upper-bound. So if the pattern X takes 10 strokes,
  then xX will take at most 11 - possibly less.
</p>

<p>
  The strategy then is to skip the left-most stripe and solve for everything to the right of it.  Then determine if the left-most stripe can be added with 0
  or 1 additional strokes.  For example: GR takes 2 stroke, but R GR also only needs 2 because the left-most and right-most stripes are the same color (You'd
  paint R first, and then put a G in the middle of it).  If the ends weren't the same color, as in B GR, then a third stripe would be needed.
</p>

<p>
  The loop at lines 63-67 divides the substring to the right of the current position into 2 segments.  It then tries every possible combination of these
  segment's lengths.  So, if the part to the right was 4 characters long, the first segment would be called with lengths 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 - while the second
  segement would have lenghts of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.  This ensures that each way of dividing up the part to the right is tried.
</p>

<p>
  The solution also uses the notion of memoization.  This has been discussed in earlier posts (see HillHike).  The idea is that once a particular pattern
  has been calculated, we'll store it so it never needs to be calculated again.  Line 70 stores each combination of start position, string length, and
  color that gets calculated.  Then at line 48, we check to see if the combination has been calculated before.  For some tests, it's not possible
  to finished within the time limit without this technique.
