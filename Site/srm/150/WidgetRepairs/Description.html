<div style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:5px;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Notes:</div>
<p>
  Each day, the repair shop takes in a number of items, and works through some other number of items.  This solution uses the variable queue to store any left over items that built up from previous days.
</p>

<p>
  Any day that had items to work on (either from a previous day, or that arrived that day) are counted as a working day.
</p>

<p>
  There's just two things to be careful of.  First, when subtracting off the number of items that are processed in a day, make sure the queue doesn't go below zero - Line 32.  And second, after items have stopped arriving, be sure to count the remaining days to work through the backlog - Lines 36-39
