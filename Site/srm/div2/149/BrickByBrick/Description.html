	<div style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:5px;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">
		Notes:
	</div>
	<p>
		This was a fun little problem to solve. I've left the printState()
		method in the source above so you can see the ball bouncing around. Just
		un-comment line 126 to enable it.
	</p>

	<p>
		The first problem was in determining how to represent the board. I
		choose to use a 2-dimensional array, roughly twice as large (in each
		dimension) as the input array. First, the board is surrounded with
		indestructible bricks. This avoids the trouble of detecting
		when the ball reaches the edge of the plaing area. The two loops at
		lines 53, and 59 create this border.
	</p>

	<p>The loop beginning at line 65 sets up the interior of the playing area. Each
		brick in the input maps to four surrounding edges in the board. The edges
		are represented as an integer which is a count of the number of bricks
		that share that edge. Any edge shared with an indestructible brick has
		a count of -1. The following example helps to illustrate:
	</p>

	<p>
			<pre>
				<u>Inuput:</u>
				.B
				BB

				<u>board:</u>
				-1  o -1 -1 -1
				-1  .  1  B -1
				-1  1     2 -1
				-1  B  2  B -1
				-1 -1 -1 -1 -1

				o - The ball, at it's starting position.

				(Note: the .'s and B's in board are only present for illustration, they are
				not stored in the array.)
			</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		The next problem is how to model the ball's movement. The details of
		this are captured within the Ball class. There are two variables, x
		and y, that keep track of it's position. deltaX, and deltaY track how
		the position changes from move to move. deltaX and deltaY both initially
		have a value of 1. When the ball bumps into a brick, either deltaX or
		deltaY is multiplied by -1 to change it's direction.
	</p>

	<p>
		An important insight is that on every move, the ball will alternate between
		passing through a top/bottom and a left/right edge. This state is
		stored in the Ball class's isSide boolean variable. So, if the ball hits
		a brick, and isSide is true, then we negate deltaX. If isSide is false,
		then deltaY is negated.
	</p>

	<p>
		Collisions are detected by comparing the ball's position to the matching
		position in the board. If the board contains a -1, then the brick is
		indestructible, and we simple call changeDir(). If the board
		contains a number > 0, then a breakable brick has been hit. First, we
		decrement the brick count and check to see if all bricks have
		been destroyed. Failing that, we find the center of the brick that was
		hit using the ball's position, whether it's hitting a side or
		top/bottom, and the direction the ball was moving. This logic is done on
		lines 153-159.  From the center, we decrement the edge count on all
		surrounding, non-indestructible, bricks.  Note, that the edge the ball
		struck must now be 0.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the illustration above, the ball will move down and right
		and encounters a 1. isSide will be true, so we know the
		center of the brick that was struck will either be one spot to the left
		or one to the right of the ball's current position. By looking at
		deltaX, we see the ball was moving left-to-right, and therefore, the
		center is the B on 2nd row from the top. On the next move, the ball will
		be moving right to left, and will strike the edge while isSide = false.
		The center of the brick will be the B in the second column from the left.
	</p>

	<p>
		So far, we have a ball that will bounce around the arena destroying
		bricks until there are none left.  The final step is to detect when there
		are un-reachable bricks.  For this, I created a Set called loopDetector
		and the Ball class's getState() methods.  On each move, getState() is
		called and the value is stored in the loopDetector.  If the ball ever
		returns to the same position, and is moving in the same direction, then
		getState() will return a value that already exists in the loopDetector set.
		Declare an infinity loop, and return -1 to quit..  Whenever a brick is
		broken, the loopDetector set is cleared.
	</p>
