<p>
  There's just two checks needed to determine if the father can be ruled out or not.  First, any character that did not come from the mother must come from the father.  If the character at position x in the child's sequence is not equal to the character at position x in the mother's sequence, then it must match the character at position x in the father's sequence.  If it does not, then we can eliminate the man from the list of potential fathers.  This is tested for by the if statemet at line 38.
</p>
<p>
  Second, the number of matches must be greater than or equal to half the length of the sequence.  For this, we simply count the number of matches on lines 45-47.
</p>
<p>
  If both conditions are met, the the man is added to the list of possible fathers.  After looping through all the men, the possible fathers list is converted into an an array, and returned.
