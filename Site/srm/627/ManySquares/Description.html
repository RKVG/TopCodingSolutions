    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

    <p>
        When I began reading the problem description, I thought this was going
        to be a whole lot harder than it turned out to be. I envisioned having
        to combine sticks toghether to form each side. Maybe one 3 + 1 side, a
        size 4 stick on another side, and two 2 + 2 on the remaining sides. That
        would make an interesting problem, but it would be way beyond division 2
        - 250 points.
    </p>

    </p>
    Luckily, the problem states that the square can only be made up of 4 sticks.
    <p>

    <p>
        I chose to use a HashMap to map a stick size, to the number of sticks
        found that are of that size. The Map's key is a size, and the value is
        the count. The for loop at line 23 iterates through the input array, and
        either sets or increments the count for each stick.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, it iterates through all the map's keys (the stick sizes), and
        divides the count by 4. This is integer division, so only the whole
        number of divisors is returned. (i.e. 3 / 4 = 0, 5 / 4 = 1). It
        increments the count by that amount, and finally returns the result.
    </p>
