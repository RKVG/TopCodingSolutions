    Notes:
</div>

<p>
    The deck is represented as an array of integers. To initialize the array, we
    just loop through all the characters in deck and assign them a value using
    the switch statement. Two things to note here: First, cards that have been
    removed are represented as a -1. This allows us to easily skip over those
    cards. No need to use an ArrayList, LinkedList or any other
    structure where you actually remove elements. Second,
    since the first action is to remove all Kings, we'll just
    take care of that up front. Lines 54 and 55 set all K's to -1.
</p>

<p>
    Next we enter a loop that will terminate only when we go through the entire
    deck without making a move. The loops always starts from the beginning
    of the deck skipping any cards that have been removed. When it gets to
    the first valid card, it then calls getNextCardIndex() get the next card
    in the deck. getNextCardIndex() handles skipping over removed cards as
    wells as looping from the end back to the beginning of the deck. If the
    two cards add up to 13, they're both marked as removed.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, when no moves could be made, the while loop exits, and we count
    up the number of cards that have not been marked as removed.
</p>

<p>
    Perhaps the most difficult part is the logic in
    getNextCardIndex(). Just be thoughtful about using the mod division
    operator, test for removed cards, and stop if you've looped all the way
    throught the deck.
