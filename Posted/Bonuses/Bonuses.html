    Notes:
</div>
<p>Lines 21-24 simply counts up the total number of points that were assigned
    across all employees.</p>
<p>Line 33 then calculates the percentage for each employee. The "/" operator
    truncates any fractions. As each
    bonus is assigned, we subtract that amount from the bonus percentage
    remaining.</p>
<p>While there is any bonus percentage remaining, we'll assign 1% to the top
    scoring employee that has not already
    received this extra bonus.</p>
<p>This is implemented by creating an array of booleans (Line 15) that keeps
    track of each employee that has
    received this extra bonus. The loop at line 51 looks for the employee with
    the greatest score that has not been awarded the bonus. Ties will go to the
    employee appearing earlier in the points array, since line 52 requires that
    the current employee's points be greater than what has already been
    seen.</p>
<p>A more efficient way to do this might be to sort the employees by score, and
    award the extra bonus starting at
    the beginning of the list until the bonus runs out. However, we'd need to
    copy the points array to the new sorted array, and maintain a mapping
    between the tow. Furthermore, we'd need to use a stable sorting algorithm,
    that is, one that does not switch the positions of two employees if their
    score is the same. I'm not sure if the standard java sorting algorithms
    guarantee this or not - so we'd be looking at implementing our own sorting
    algorithm, which is not hard, but not necessary for this
    problem.</p>
<p>Update: Java's Collections.sort() is guaranteed to be stable.</p>
