    Notes:
</div>
<p>This problem has a few gotchas that you need to be aware of. And a few
    details weren't entirely clear from the description. I'll point these out as
    we walk through the code.</p>
<p>I chose to model the roundabout (we call them traffic circles here) as an
    array of 4 characters, and the roads leading in as an array of lists of
    characters. You might implement the roundabout as a circular linked list,
    and the roads as Queues. Lines 182-193 just create and initialize these
    data structures.</p>
<p>On line 201 we begin the main loop of the program. It will continue so
    long as
    there is a vehicle in either the roundabout, or any of the queues. The first
    thing, is to create a copy of the current state. This is important because
    we'll be removing vehicles, but also need to remember where they were to
    determine if a vehicle can enter.</p>
<p>This is the first tricky part. Many people have assumed that if a vehicle is
    exiting, then one in the next position is free to enter. This is not true,
    so be careful.</p>
<p>Line 207 calls processExit() to remove any vehicles that have reached their
    destination. This is a simple check to see if there is an 'N' in the north
    position, an 'E' in the east position, etc. and if so, replaces them with a
    '-'. I use the '-' or SPACE constant throughout to denote an opening.</p>
<p>Line 208 then calls processEntry() to see which cars may enter the circle. As
    noted above, it's important to provide this with a copy of the roundabout's
    state from before the vehicles exited.</p>
<p>Next, we advance all the vehicles in the circle, then advance the vehicles up
    in their queues, and finally increment the time.</p>
<p>processEntry() on line 80 handles all the logic for determining which
    vehicles may enter the roundabout. The special case of when all four
    vehicles are able enter is handled in lines 91-101. This avoids a gridlock
    situation.</p>
<p>Each queue checks both the roundabout position to it's left, and the queue to
    it's left; and if both are clear, then it enters the roundabout. Note that I
    place the new entrant one space back in the clock-wise direction because the
    advanceCircle() method will be called next which moves all vehicles ahead -
    putting it in the proper place.</p>
<p>Here's the second part that was a bit confusing. If there are cars at the
    head of the South and West roads, and the only car in the roundabout is at
    the North. You might think it's clear for the South car to enter. Since the
    West car cannot enter due to the car at the North, it should therefore be
    safe for the South car to go. Again, be careful, and just stick to the
    problem description.</p>
<p>The final two remaining methods, advanceCircle(), and advanceQueues() are
    very straightforward. advanceCircle() moves each vehicle one space around
    the roundabout, while advanceQueues() removes the first space in the queues
    leading up to the circle.</p>
<p>I've left the printState() method in to assist in debugging the code. This
    problem in particular really benefits from seeing what happens during each
    iteration.</p>
