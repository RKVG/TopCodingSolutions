    Notes:
</div>
<p>
    In my first attempt at this problem, I used a solution involving tries.
    Everything went smoothly, it passed all my tests on the first
    attempt. I submitted to the TopCoder arena, and it passed all their tests -
    except test #27. There's a 2 second time limit, and my code took about two
    and a half minutes to pass. Time to scrap the code, and use a better
    algorithm. If your interested, code for the first attempt is available
    <a href="https://www.topcodingsolutions.net/srm/div1/149/500alt">here.</a>
</p>

<p>
    The second attempt uses dynamic programming and is a huge
    improvement performance wise. Test #27 now runs in 0.008 seconds!
</p>

<p>
    It begins by initializing two arrays: numOfSolutions[] and solutions[].
    numOfSolutions[x] contains the number of ways that position x in the
    message can reached starting from the beginning. So, if my dictionary
    contains {"H", "I", "HI"}, and the message is "HIT" - there are two ways
    to arrive at the letter T. Either start with H, then use I; or just
    start with HI.
    The goal is numOfSolutions[numOfSolutions.length - 1] = 1. That is - there
    is one, and only one, way to reach the end of the message.
</p>

<p>
    The second array solutions[] contains the decoded message that
    led up to that point. Each position is initialized to "IMPOSSIBLE!".
    The first time a position is reached, solutions[x] gets set to the
    decoded message at that point. If the position is reached again via
    another path, then solutions[x] is set to "AMBIGUOUS!".
</p>

<p>
    Then, it's just a matter of looping through each character in the
    message. If there was no way to reach that character, or if that
    character has been reach by more than one path, then we'll skip
    it - leaving it as either IMPOSSIBLE! or AMBIGUOUS!.
</p>

<p>
    If there is one path to that character, then we try appending each
    dictionary word to our current position. If adding the dictionary word does
    not take us beyond the end of the message, and it matches the next
    sequence of characters, then we'll mark the end of the new combined message
    as having 1 solution if it had 0 before, or 2 if it had 1 before.
    There's no need to keep incrementing the solution count beyond 2. If the
    solution count becomes 2, the solution is marked as AMBIGUOS!.
</p>

<p>
    Upon reaching the return statement, the solutions array will contain
    either IMPOSSIBLE!, AMBIGUOUS!, or a valid solution for every substring of
    the message that starts at the beginning.  So, it's just a matter of
    returning the last value, and not forgetting to trim off the final space.
