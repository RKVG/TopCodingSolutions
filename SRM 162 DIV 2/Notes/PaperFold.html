    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  We need to consider two possibilities.  First, that we can fold the paper length-wise and width-wise until it fits in box, and
  second, that we must first rotate the paper, and then fold it down to fit into the box.  We'll try both ways, and go with the
  one that takes fewer folds.
</p>

<p>
  On line 10, f1 is assigned the number of folds required if the maximum dimension of the paper is aligned with the maximum dimension
  of the box.  On the next line, f2 is assigned the number of folds if this were rotated 90&deg;.
</p>

<p>
  The countFolds() method simply counts how many times the box's dimension needs to be doubled before it can fit the paper.  I choose to
  double the size of the box rather than halving the size of the paper to avoid having to convert to doubles in order to deal with
  fractions.
