    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        The constraints of this problem make it small enough that a brute-force method works well.  We could just
        start at 1 and check to see if it is a Least Common Multiple (LCM) of each number in the range.  If not,
        just increment by 1 and try again.  A simple optimization is to note that our answer must be a multiple
        of last.  So we can start our search there, and increment by the value of last to get the next number
        to test.
    </p>

    <p>
        The % operator is used to determine if one number divides another evenly.  if ((a % b) == 0) then b
        evenly divides a.  Or, a is a multiple of b.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note the break; statement in the inner-most while loop.  This lets us quit on a potential LCM as soon as we
        find a number that it is not a multiple of.  When the break is encountered, i will be <= last, and the
        if statement below will use this to determine if a LCM has been found or not.
