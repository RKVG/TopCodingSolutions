    <div class="header">Overview:</div>
    <p>
        Remove double letters from the left side of a String until no more double letters exist.
    </p>

02: 
03:     public String ableToSolve(String S) {

14:                 if (sb.charAt(i) == sb.charAt(i + 1)) {

22:             }

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  First, I create a StringBuilder object out of the given String.  This will make deleting characters from the string more efficient.
  Every time a String is modified in Java, a new object is created.  On the other hand, StringBuilder is mutable.
</p>

<p>
  I used the boolean variable changed to note when any characters have been deleted.  If we pass through the entire string with no changes,
  then we're done.  Note that I call sb.deleteCharAt(i) twice.  The first deletes the first characters, and causes all subsequent characters to
  shift one place to the left.  The second call deletes the second of the double characters.
</p>

<p>
  Upon exiting the while loop, simply check the size of the remaining string, and return Possible or Impossible accordingly.
