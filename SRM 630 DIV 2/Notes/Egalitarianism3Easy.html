    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    
<p>
  There's a lot going on in this problem. It's tough for division 2 level 2. The solution uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to determine
  the shortest distance between all pairs of cities.  If you're unfamiliar with the algorighm, check out this video tutorial. 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TRX85-myD4">Floyd-Warshall Tutorial</a> Take the time to work through the example until you
  understand what's going on.
</p>

<p>
  One thing to be careful of when using this algorithm: you can't set unknown distances to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  The reason is that we
  need to add two distances together, and this will cause an overflow.  To avoid this, I created INF_DISTANCE which is 1 greater than
  any possible distance given the constraints of the problem.
</p>

<p>
  When the section labeled Floyd-Warshall's algorithm complets, the distances[][] will contain a table that maps the distance from
  any city to any other city.  Then we just need to find the sets of cities that match the criteria, and determine the largest.
</p>

<p>
  The number of possible subsets of all cities is reasonably small.  Just 2^10 = 1024.  So it's very possible to generate all
  combinations and test each one.  To generate all possible subsets, I used a trick using a bit mask.  It's the first time a solution
  on this site has used it, so I'll go into some detail as to how it works.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine each set of cities is represented as a binary string.  So "0000000111" would represent a set that included cities 0, 1, and 2.  "1000000000"
  is a set that includes only city 9, and "1111111111" contains all cities.  By simply counting from 0 to 2^n (Where n is the number of cities/bits)
  we'll get every possible combination of bits.<br/>
  Note that care must be taken because the cities start at 1 and not 0.  So city 9 is actually represented by the 10th bit from the right. city 0 is
  in the first bit on the right.
</p>

<p>
  Now, to tell if a given city is in the current set, we'll use an expression such as (citySetMask & (1 << city1) where citySetMask is the current binary
  pattern, and city1 is the city that we're checking.  The << operator taks the value of 1 (...001) and shifts it's bits to the left by the value of city1.
  Let's say our citySetMask is "0001010111" and city1 is 4.  The << operator will take 1 (0000000001) and shift if over 4 places (0000010000).  We then
  use the bit-wise and operator & to test the two values.  In this case, the city is in the set.
</p>

<p>
  The remainder of the logic if pretty straight forward.  We initialize citySetDistance to -1.  Then when the first other city is found, we'll set that
  to the distance between those first two cities.  allDistancesEqual is set to false if we ever find a pair of cities whose distances is not what
  was previously set in citySetDistance.  When allDistancesEqual becomes false, both the inner and outer while loops terminate, and we give up
  on the current set.  If all cities in the set do have equal distances, then we set max to the larger of max or cityCount.
</p>

<p>
  Again, this is pretty tough for a division 2 level 2 problem.  Compared to the early single round matches, like the 100 series, this would
  be a division 1 level 2 or division 2 level 3 problem at least, but that appears to be the way things are going with these newer problem sets.
