    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  Start by declaring constants to hold the number of shillings in a pound and the number of pennies in a shillings.  Using that,
  we can calculate the number of pennies in a shilling (20 * 12 = 240).  From here we can use simple math to derive our answer.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that in Java, integer division chops off the remainder.  so 10 / 3 = 3.  Therefore, the number of pounds, is simply the
  number of pence / PENNIES_PER_POUND.
</p>

<p>
  The moduls operator % gives us the remainder.  To calculate the number of shillings, we first get the remainder of after taking
  out as many pounds as possible (pence % PENNIES_PER_POUND).  Then, just as before, we divide that by PENNIES_PER_SHILLING to get
  the number of shillings.
</p>

<p>
  The number of pennies remaining is just pence % PENNIES_PER_SHILLING.
</p>

<p>
  Just store each of those values in the correct location of an int[] and the problem is solved.
