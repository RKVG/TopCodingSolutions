        Determine the number of processors that will finish a job in the shortest amount of time.
        Additional processors will help divide the load, but incur an exponential communication cost.

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  The approach taken here is to calculate the time it takes to solve the problem using one processor, and
  then add additional processors until the time stops decreasing.  There are two forces at work here.  Each
  additional processor helps us by spreading the load.  Whenever the number of processors doubles, the amount
  of time it takes to process the job is cut in half.  As the number of processors grows, the gains diminish.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, with additional processors, the communication overhead increases at an exponential rate.
  <code>((p * (p-1) / 2) * overhead</code>
  Eventually, the cost of the communication overhead must overcome the benefit of additional processors.  From
  that point on, additional processors will only slow the task down.  Therefore, we can quit as soon as the
  time levels out or starts to become larger.
</p>

<p>
  The time it takes to process the job is the communication overhead, plus the number of tasks divided by
  the number of processors.  If the number of tasks does not divide evenly by the number of processors, then
  one extra round will be needed to complete those remainders.
</p>

<p>
  Note that if the number of processors gets very large, it is likely that the values of o and time will
  overflow.  By returning as soon as time begins increasing, this problem is avoided.  Also note, that
  we can set the initial upper limit for the fastest time to k - that is the amount of time it would
  take 1 processor to handle k tasks.
