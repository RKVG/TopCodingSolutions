    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  Somehow, this problem seems like it would be easier it we were counting the colors across rows instead of down columns.  But, no matter,
  the problem is not difficult if you can keep your directions straight.
</p>

<p>
  To help keep things clear, I set numRows and numColumns on rows 6 and 7.  This makes it much easier than trying to keep track of
  them using grid.length and grid[0].length().
</p>

<p>
  Next, we set maxVal to the smallest possible integer.  Then, on lines 29 and 35 we'll potentially update that using Math.max().
  This pattern comes up in almost every problem, and this is the cleanest way I've found to write it.
</p>

<p>
  Then, there are two nested for loops.  The outer loops across the columns, and the inner loops down the rows in each column.  At
  the start of a new column, we set reset count, and set the current color to be the first color in the column.  Then we go down
  the column, incrementing count each time the current position matches currentColor.  When they no longer match, cut off the current
  streak by updating currentColor, resetting count, and updating the maxVal if this streak is longer than any we've seen thus far.
</p>

<p>
  After we've looped through all columns, return the maximum value found.
