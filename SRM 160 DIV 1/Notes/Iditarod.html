    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  Not much difficulty here.  avgMinutes() loops through all the finishing times and keeps a running total of the number of minutes for all the competitors
  to finish.  Then it just divides the today by the number of times - casting to double to avoid losing decimal places.  To round off, just add 0.5 and
  truncate - a trick everyone should know.  There's no danger of overflow here, so just stick with the simplest thing that works.
</p>

<p>
  Calculating the number of minutes for a given time is also pretty simple.  We just need to take care dealing with the 12:00 PM and 12:00 AM hours.  Here,
  if it's 12 PM, I set the hours to 0.  If it's 12 AM, I set hours to 24, and subtract a day.  Then for any PM times, I add 12 hours.  It may take a minute
  to think it through, but it's not tough.  Remember to subtract off the 8:00 AM starting time.  Then it's just a matter of adding up the number of minutes
  in a day, an hour, and the minutes portion.
