    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
	To solve this problem, we'll use two indexes sIdx and tIdx to walk through the Strings s and t.  The indexes both start at
	position 0.  So long as the characters are equal, the indexes increment together.  If the character in s does not match
	the corresponding position in t, we'll advance sIdx - so long as sIdx and tIdx were previously equal.  If the indexes
	were not equal, then we've found a second mismatch, so return "Impossible".
</p>

<p>
	If we make it all the way to tIdx == t.length(), then return possible.
</p>

<p>
	A check at the beginning of the method ensures that the length of s is exactly one character longer than t.
