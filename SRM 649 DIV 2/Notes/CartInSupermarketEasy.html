        Calculate the shortest time to remove a chain of shopping carts.  In each unit of time,
        a chain of carts can either be split, or have a cart removed from the segment.

<p>
	This solution is a great example of Dynamic Programming.  We'll begin with the minimum amount of time required
  to process a simple chain of carts (0, 1, or 2 cart chains), and then use that to calculate the time for larger
  chains.  We continue using what we've already calculated to build up larger chains until we've reached our goal.
</p>

<p>
	  We start by declaring an int[][] knownTimes.  The first dimension holds a number of carts, the second
	  dimension is a number of splits allowed, and the value is the best time that we can achieve under
	  those constraints.  The array is initialized as follows:
	  <ol>
	  	<li>If the number of carts is 0, 1, or 2; then we can trivially remove all carts in 1 minute per cart</li>
	  	<li>If there a 0 splits, then all we can do is remove 1 cart per minute.</li>
	  	<li>In all other cases, we set the value to -1 to denote that we'll need to calculate the value</li>
	  </ol>       
</p>

<p>
	The real work is done in the solve() method.  First, check to see if we already know the solution for
	the given number of carts and splits.  If so, just return that.  Otherwise, we'll need to calculate it.
	Note that at this point, the number of splits must be at least one, becase we've initialized knowTimes
	with vaues for whenever the number of splits is 0.
</p>

<p>
	We now have two options - we can either remove a cart, or try to split the chain.  If we choose to remove
	a cart, our time will be solve(numCarts - 1, numSplits) plus 1 additional minute.  This is the longest
	we could possibly need.
</p>

<p>
	If we choose to split the carts, we can do so in many different ways.  For a chain of x carts, the splits
	could result in segments of size (1, x-1), (2, x-2), ... (x-1, 1).  And for each of these combinations,
	the number of splits can be divided up in numerous ways between the two resulting segments.  The nested
	for loops work through all possibled combinations.
</p>

<p>
	For each split that is considered, our time to solve will be the maximum of the time it takes to solve
	the two child segments, plus one additional minute (to perform the split).  As each solution is
	calculated, we compare it to what we already have and keep the minimum.  When done, we store the
	minimum time in knownTimes for future use, and then return it.
