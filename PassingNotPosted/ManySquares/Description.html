<p>
When I began reading the problem description, I thought this was going to be a whole lot harder than it turned out to be.  I envisioned having to combine sticks toghether to form each side.  Maybe one 3 + 1 side, a size 4 stick on another side, and two 2 + 2 on the remaining sides.  That would make an interesting problem, but it would be way beyond division 2 - 250 points.
</p>

</p>
Luckily, the problem states that the square can only be made up of 4 sticks.
<p>
	
<p>
I chose to use a HashMap to map a stick size, to the number of sticks found that are of that size.  The Map's key is a size, and the value is the count.  The for loop at line 23 iterates through the input array, and either sets or increments the count for each stick.
</p>

<p>
	Thes, it iterates through all the map's keys (the stick sizes), and divides the count by 4.  This is integer division, so only the whole number of divisors is returned.  (i.e. 3 / 4 = 0,  5 / 4 = 1).  It increments the count by that amount, and finally returns the result.
