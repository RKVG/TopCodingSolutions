    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  We can create a legal arrangmenet if two conditions are met.  First the number of boys must equals the number
  of girls.  Second, the number of both must be divisible by two.  Since we've already checked that they're equal,
  we only need to test one.  These two conditions become pretty clear if you draw the solution out on a piece of paper.
</p>

<p>
  We'll start by separating the boys from the girst.  We can use Java's String.split() method to get the name
  and gender of each attendee.  The espression split("\\s+") just splits on the next whitespace.  Then we
  assign them to the correct Queue.  A PriorityQueue was choosen it because it automatically keeps the entries
  in a sorted order.  We'll get the names in the order we need them practically for free.
</p>

<p>
  Next, we check to see that the two conditions are met.  If so, we can proceed to building the result.  The
  result String[] will have a length 2 larger than the input - in order to hold the HOST and HOSTESS.  Position
  0 gets the host, and length / 2 gets the HOSTESS.  Then it's just a matter of alternating between pulling
  the next girl and then boy off their respective queues until the result array is full.
