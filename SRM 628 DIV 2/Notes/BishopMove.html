    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        It helps to think in terms of the basic properties of how a Bishop
        moves. The following three rules are all you need to solve this problem:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>If the change in the number of rows from the starting square to the
            destination is the same as the change in the number of columns; then
            the Bishop can reach that square in 1 move.
        </li>
        <li>From it's starting position, the Bishop can reach any square where
            the difference in rows minus the difference in columns is an even
            multiple of 2.
        </li>
        <li>Any square that can be reached by the Bishop will take at most 2
            moves.
    </ol>

    <p>
        This logic is implemented on lines 25, 31, and 34, and respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Add to that a quick check at line 19 to see if any move is even
        necessary, and you're done.
    </p>
