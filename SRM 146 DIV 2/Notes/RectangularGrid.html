    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>This problem is solved in two steps.  First, I calculate the total number of rectangles, including squares, that can be found in the rectangular grid.  Then, I subtract off the number of squares.</p>
    <p>The formula for the number of rectangles in the grid is given in the comment on line 37, and is calculated on lines 40-42.  Be careful here as this number can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an int.  Lines 31 and 32 convert width and height to longs so these new variables can be used in the calculation - avoiding a lot of ugly casting.</p>
    <p>The second step is to subtract off the number of squares.  For this, we consider squares of size 1 x 1 up to N x N where N is the minimum of height and width. Lines 52-55.</p>
    <p>The method findSquaresInRectangle() calculates the number of squares that can be found in a rectangular grid.  There may be a formula for this, but it's pretty straight forward to figure it out.</p>
    <p>Imagine a square of size s x s positioned in the top left corner of the rectangle.  We then slide it right one space, and then again, until the right edge of the square falls outside the bounds of the rectangle. Line 20.  Then move it down one row and repeat.  Keep going until moving it down causes the bottom edge of the square to go outside the rectangle. Line 21.</p>
