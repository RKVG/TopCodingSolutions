    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
  This is about as easy as it gets.  It took longer to read the problem description than to actually code it up.
  Nevertheless, there's still a few things worth noting.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that we can use String.charAt(i) to get the character at a given position in the String.  Also chars in java
  are treated as 16-bit integers, so we can do normal integer arithmetic on them.  The letters 'a' - 'z' are guaranteed to be
  consecutive, as are 'A' - 'Z'.  So an expression like 'c' - 'a' will yield a value of 2.  In this problem, the actual ascii
  values of the characters does not matter (A = 65 by the way). 
</p>

<p>
  To get the number of key presses for each letter we just subtract 'A' from that letter.  But since, 'A' - 'A' would be 0,
  we need to add 1 to each value.
</p>

<p>
  The variable count is initialized to 0, and then is incremented by the value of each new letter.  The operator +=
  is just a sort cut for writing "count = count + ..."
</p>
