  <div class="header">Notes:</div>
  <p>
    There are three conditions that we need to check:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Each letter must be an uppercase, english letter.</li>
    <li>There are no consecutive letters</li>
    <li>There are no patters of the form xyxy - where are and why are any (not necessarily distinct) seqquences of characters</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The first condition is actually unnecessary since the problem's constraints guarantee that each character will be an uppercase
    English letter.  Nevertheless, I've choosen to include the check.  Note that, technically, we can't use Character.isUpperCase()
    to test the character, since isUpperCase() will return true for some non-English characters.  But, again, it's sort of a moot point.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the second condition, we just loop through each character and look at the next character.  Just be careful to stop the
    loop one character early, so that looking at the next position is not out of bounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last condition is the trickiest, but it's not that hard if you allow regular expressions expressions to do all the work.
    We build the following regular expression .*x.*y.*x.*x.*  and if our word matches that, return false.  We do however need
    two nested for loops in order to check each letter with each possible following letter.
