    <div class="header">Notes:</div>

    <p>
        Imagine creating two Strings s1 and t1 such that s1 = s + s + s ... and t1 = t + t + t + t + ...
        and the length of both s1 and t1 is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of s and t.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example if s = "ababab" and t = "abab", then the length of s is 6, the length of t is 4, and their
        least common multiple is 12.  Therefore, s1 = s + s = "abababababab" and t1 = t + t + t = "abababababab".
        Since s1 == t1 we should return "Equal"
    </p>

    <p>
        The important point is that if we step through the Strings s and t one character at a time, and loop
        back to the beginning of the String when we reach the end; then we can stop when we reach the end
        of both s and t at the same time.  That's the condition that is checked for in the while loop.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest is just a matter of checking that the characters match at each position, and incrementing
        and resetting the pointer to the current character.
    </p>
