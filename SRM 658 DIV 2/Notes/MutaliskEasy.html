    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
    <p>
        My first approach was a simple greedy algorithm.  I sorted the opponents according to the amount of hit points
        they had remaining, and then assigned the biggest attack to the opponent with most hit points remaining, the
        next biggest attack to the next strongest opponent, and the last attack to the third strongest opponent.  Then
        I re-sorted the opponents, and repeated.  As the first test shows, this approach does not work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, we'll need to try every possible combination.
    </p>

    <p>
        The minimalAttacks(int,int,int) method begins by ensuring we don't allow the hit point values to go below 0.
        Then it checks to see if we've already solved for this combination of x, y, and z.  If so, then we can just
        return that value  This technique is called memoization, and allows up to skip the calculations that follow if
        they've already been carried out.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we don't already have a result, then the loops on lines 62-77 will recursively call minimalAttacks with
        every possible combination of assigning attacks to the various opponents.  We keep track of the best result
        in the minAttacks variable, and then store this in the results matrix before returning it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The minimalAttacks(int[]) method checks for a few easy cases (length of x is 0 or 1), and failing that
        initializes the results matrix, and then uses minimalAttacks(int, int, int) to calculate the result.
    </p>
