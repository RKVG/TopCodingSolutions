        Determine the number of experience point a character needs in order to reach the next level.

    <div class="code">
<pre>
     1	public class LevelUp {
     2
     3		public int toNextLevel(int[] expNeeded, int received) {

     5			int i = 0;

     8	        * Find the first expNeeded element that is greater
     9	        * than received.
    10	        */
    11	        while (expNeeded[i] <= received) i++;
    12
    13	        /*
    14	        * Return the difference between the next level, and
    15	        * the amount received.
    16	        */

    <div class="header">Notes:</div>
<p>
    Certainly one of the easiest problems to solve.  Just loop through the values in expNeeded
    until you find one that is greater than received.  Then just return that next value minus
    the amount of received.
</p>

    <p>
        Really the only thing to be careful of is the case where the amount received exactly
        equals the amount needed for a level.  In this case, return the amount needed to
        reach the next level, and not 0.
